//////////////////////////////
// Command file for leod's bot.
/////
//
// Needs to export a 'call' function that returns a response object as specified in bot_core.
// function call(args, memory, bot, message, config)
//   args: Arguments passed in by the user, like "m!markov arguments are these words"
//   info: An object with information about the current bot state. Keys:
//     memory: The global memory object the bot posesses. Can be manipulated by returning a "memory" dict in the response.
//     message: Discord.js's Message object. Represents the message that triggered this command, if it is a command.
//     command: The name of the command being called, if it is a command.
//     hook: If set, the command was called through a message hook instead of an explicit command.
//     bot: Discord.js Client object. Represents the bot.
//     config: The config object.
//     core: A subset of bot_core to expose some functions to commands. Is eventEmitter, look at its definition in init() for functions.
//           Pay special attention to the command* helper functions.
//
// Additionally, exports a 'help' function that is to return a help string about how to use the command. It receives the following:
// 	 config: The config object. Useful for prefixes or to check if a functionality is enabled.
//   command: The name of the command being asked for help on.
//   message: Discord.js's Message object. Represents the message that asked for help.
//
// Lastly, exports a "level" string, which denotes the power level needed to use this command.
//  "all" means that anyone can use it.
//  "staff" means that only staff members can use it (if use_hierarchy is true).
//  "admin" means that only the bot owner can use it.
/////

// Level of authority required.
exports.level = "admin";

// Help function:
exports.help = (config, command, message) => {
	return `Set my profile picture, either by giving me a URL or by uploading an image with your message. \
					\nUsage: \`${config.prefix}${command} [URL]\``;
}

// Command logic:
const isUrl = require('is-url-superb');

exports.call = (args, info) => {

	// Check if first argument is a link.
	var found_link = false;
	if(args.length !== 0) {
		if(isUrl(args[0])) {
			setAvatar(args[0], info);
			found_link = true;
		}
	} 

	// If no URL was found, try and use the image embed.
	if(!found_link) {
		const embedded_image = info.message.attachments.first();
		if(embedded_image && !isNaN(embedded_image.height)) {
			setAvatar(embedded_image.url, info);
			found_link = true;
		}
	}


	return {
		"log": `New profile picture setting attempt by ${info.message.author.tag} (${info.message.author.id}).`,
		"msg": found_link ? "" : "Missing URL or image.",
	};
}

function setAvatar(url, info) {
	info.bot.user.setAvatar(url)
		.then(() => {
			info.message.channel.send("Profile picture set. I am so good looking.");
			info.core.log(`Successfully set profile picture to ${url}.`, "profile picture");
		})
		.catch(() => {
			info.message.channel.send("Invalid image or URL.");
			info.core.log(`Could not set profile picture to ${url}.`, "profile picture");
